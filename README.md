# LEEGO Resident Evil
A game engine written in C using a virtual filesystem. This was a small
internal prototype to test portability, build systems and removing the
need for a filesystem.

It is written entirely in ANSI C so that it could be ported to platforms
without an adequate C++ compiler. Projects deriving from this code
used an early build of Emscripten to support HTML5 / WebGL targets,
long before commercial game engines caught up.

*** DISCLAIMER ***
This game is not related to or endorsed by LEGO in any way. Even though
at the time I was working for a company where we developed a number of
LEGO gaming titles, this internal tech was more of an inside joke. At
the very most it would have been a failed pitch ;)

I no longer plan to work on this project. The main reason I am uploading
it is because many thousands of lines of code (this project) was very
almost lost when I was wiping an old hard drive. Rather than send this
hard work to the abyss just because I personally no longer need it,
I would rather others potentially enjoy or learn from it.

Enjoy!
